- 👋 Hi, I’m Chang Huang @neclipse
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new stuff in the tech world and keen to apply them in real life. I have been coding since undergrad, and that's more focused on  computation on solid mechanics, fracture mechanics. You can check out [nonlinear solid mechanics platform in Matlab](https://github.com/neclipse/FEA-in-Matlab-NSMOOM) or [hydraulic fracturing simulation using XFEM](https://github.com/neclipse/HFXFEM-Multiple-Cracks) if you are doing related research or applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build my own website to showcase my work and projects better.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web application development, especially in UI improvement and scaling.
- 📫 You can reach me at huangchang73@gmail.com.
